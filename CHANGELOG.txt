==== vDemo-2 ====
New Items:
- Ardentipedes/Caster Imps now drop Scrolls. When opened, these spells will give
  instructions on how to cast a spell, and can either be used on the spot for a
  single burst of magic, or attuned to the Gate of Anthrakia for longer-term
  magical applications.
    - Added the spell "Winds of Libidine", which is accessible via scroll only
	  by default.
	- Added a new customization option that allows the Gate of Anthrakia to 
	  start with different assortments of spells.

Fixes:
- Fixed a bug where O:DR attempted to replace items that were already replaced,
  resulting in VM Aborts.
- Fixed a bug where the Grasa could spawn an empty mag out of the aether if
  reloading with nothing in your inventory.
- Fixed a bug where the Nimurdal wasn't associated with its weapon and would
  be dropped when using the "Purge Useless Ammo" command.
- Grasa Mags and arrows now correctly use the Language files for their pickup 
  messages.

Changes:
- All weapons with loadout codes now display them in the Loadout Manager.
    - Hideous Destructor v4.7.1c or higher is now required.

- Reduced the base spread of the Cintia 1901. (9.0->8.0)
- Reduced the scaling for the Cintia 1901's choke to be consistent with the 
  Hunter. (0.75->0.5)
- The Cintia 1901's lever animation has been adjusted; the weapon now remains 
  closer to the ready position during lever action.
- Significantly sped up the Cintia 1901's lever. (10->7)
- Sound effects for the Cintia 1901's lever should line up more clearly with the
  animation.
- Added a sound cue to the Cintia 1901 for the chamber cycling. (This should
  make judging the timing easier.)
- Added a subtle camera shift to the lever sequence.
- Added a clearer "jamming" sequence when short-stroking the Cintia 1901.
- The Cintia 1901's lever is now held open if you hold down altfire.
- The Cintia 1901 now properly ejects the shell when the lever is fully opened, 
  rather than as it's closing.
- The Cintia 1901 can now slamfire by holding Fire and working the lever.

- Added a new sprite for a Grasa with no mag inserted.
- Increased the window before the Grasa determines whether or not to pocket a 
  magazine while reloading/unloading. (4->6)
- Added an indicator to the HUD to show when the Grasa suffers a Failure to
  Eject.
- Sound cues for the Grasa suffering a Failure to Eject should no longer be 
  drowned out by the firing sounds
- The Grasa M-12's base rate of fire has been significantly reduced (2->5)
- The Grasa M-12 will now occasionally spawn with different parts
    - Hacked Bolt (1): The bolt has been modified to increase rate of fire, but 
	  wears out much faster.
	- Improved Bolt Assembly (2): The bolt wears out at half the normal rate, 
	  reducing Failure to Eject errors.
    - You can choose to start with these mods with the "modtype" loadout 
	  variable, and options have been added to adjust the spawnrate.
	- These mods stack; use "modtype 3" to start with both.
- Zombies carrying the Grasa now reflect the lower fire rate, and can spawn 
  with modified Grasa variants.

- Reduced the density of flames spawned by Pit of Eresia. (This should help 
  some machines with performance.)

- Holding the Heki at full draw builds fatigue instead of simply causing your
  aim to shake.
    - You will automatically release your draw if your fatigue is too high.
